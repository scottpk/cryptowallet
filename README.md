# Scott's Crypto Wallet

A clever name will come later. Anyway, this project is to become a set of webapi's and UI for crypto wallets (bitcoin will be the first target).

## Why?

Any experienced/knowledgeable crypto enthusiast knows the adage:

> Not your keys, not your coins... - _Aristotle, reflecting on mt. gox_

If you're new to crypto, basically... if the crypto isn't on your device, then if the exchange gets hacked (or just your account on that exchange) you don't have it at all. Crypto exchanges are not a bank, they are not insured (necessarily) if you lose all of your holdings - they're in the business of selling you the crypto not necessarily securing it. That responsibility falls to you.

So, people in the know use various "wallets" - there are hardware wallets, software wallets, open-source apps, desktop-based apps, phone-based apps... all of which do the job.

Well, OK. But the reason (or at least one of them) people leave money in the exchange, is that it's convenient. Want several Bitcoin wallet addresses, BlockFi can handle that for you... have several different apps that use altcoins, Coinbase can generate any of those wallets for you... bought it on your computer but now you're at the cash register or Bitcoin ATM, no problem because it synced. Lost your phone, no problem. Dead laptop battery, no problem.

### So what's your solution?

The idea would be a self-hostable wallet manager that is accessible online if you put the time and effort into putting it there. With modern standards, easy setup, automatic backup of all your wallets, easy access from any device, full 2FA to protect things, QR code scanning for easy transfer...

### Why this wallet / wallet manager?

Well if you're not tech-savvy, there probably won't be much reason. But if you are, and you've already got your own NAS, and a reverse proxy, and a domain, and what not... then it'll be self-hosted, and with time it'll hopefully manage myriad wallets.
